1. A transaction is a unit of work that might include multiple activities that query and modify
data and that can also change the data definition.

1. Atomicity A transaction is an atomic unit of work. Either all changes in the transaction
take place or none do.
Consistency The term consistency refers to the state of the data that the relational
database management system (RDBMS) gives you access to as concurrent transactions
modify and query it. 
Isolation Isolation ensures that transactions access only consistent data. You control
what consistency means to your transactions through a mechanism called isolation
levels. 
Durability Data changes are always written to the database’s transaction log on disk
before they are written to the data portion of the database on disk.

1. To obtain a lock on a certain resource type, your transaction must first obtain intent locks
of the same mode on higher levels of granularity.

1.  holds a lock on a data resource and another transaction requests an
incompatible lock on the same resource

1. request_session_id AS sid,
resource_type AS restype,
resource_database_id AS dbid,
DB_NAME(resource_database_id) AS dbname,
resource_description AS res,
resource_associated_entity_id AS resid,
request_mode AS mode,
request_status AS status

1. session_id AS sid,
login_time,
host_name,
program_name,
login_name,
nt_user_name,
last_request_start_time,
last_request_end_time

1.This view has a row for each active request, including blocked
requests.

1. Isolation levels determine the level of consistency you get when you interact with data.

1.  the SERIALIZABLE isolation level behaves similarly to REPEATABLE
READ: namely, it requires a reader to obtain a shared lock to be able to read, and it keeps the
lock until the end of the transaction. But the SERIALIZABLE isolation level adds another facet
—logically, this isolation level causes a reader to lock the whole range of keys that qualify
for the query’s filter. This means that the reader locks not only the existing rows that qualify
for the query’s filter, but also future ones.

1. A deadlock is a situation in which two or more sessions block each other. An example of a
two-session deadlock is when session A blocks session B and session B blocks session A.
